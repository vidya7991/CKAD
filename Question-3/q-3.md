3. Services and Exposure (12 Minutes)
You need to expose an existing application running on an internal port.

Context: A Deployment named backend-api exists in the default namespace. The application inside its Pods listens on port 8080.

Create a Service named api-service that targets the backend-api Pods (assume they have the label app=backend-api).

The Service should be of type NodePort and expose the application on port 80 internally, mapping to the target port 8080.

The NodePort value must be set to 30080.

Verification: Use kubectl describe svc api-service to confirm the ports are correctly configured, and demonstrate connectivity using a simple curl command (simulating a test from an outside node). Note: The cluster environment for the exam will provide an IP/Node to test against.
