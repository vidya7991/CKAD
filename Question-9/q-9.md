9. The Deployment with Initializer (Deployment & Init Container)
You need a front-end application that depends on the data API being ready and performs an initial setup.

Create a Deployment named frontend-app with 3 replicas in the data-processor-ns namespace using the image nginx.

Implement an Init Container named wait-for-api using the image busybox. This container must execute a command that pauses for 10 seconds before completion (e.g., ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Waiting for API startup...'; sleep 10;"]).

The Deployment's main container must have the Secret's username exposed as an environment variable named DB_USER and the password exposed as an environment variable named DB_PASS.
