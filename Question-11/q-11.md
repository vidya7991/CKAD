1. Multi-Container with Init and ConfigMap (12 Minutes)
This question focuses on Pod initialization and passing configuration to a sidecar.

Create a Namespace named ckad-q1-init.

Create a ConfigMap named startup-settings with a key WAIT_TIME and value 15.

Create a Pod named ready-pod in the ckad-q1-init namespace.

Implement an Init Container named initializer using the image busybox. This container should execute a command that pauses for the duration specified by the ConfigMap key WAIT_TIME (Hint: mount the ConfigMap to a file and read the value, or use valueFrom: configMapKeyRef).

Implement a multi-container architecture by adding a main container named app (image nginx) and a sidecar container named monitor (image busybox).

The monitor sidecar container must continuously echo the current date every 5 seconds.

Verification: Check the events of the ready-pod to confirm the initializer container completed before the main containers started.
