StatefulSet Volume and PVC Management (12 Minutes)
This question focuses on persistent storage within a stateful application.

Create a Namespace named ckad-q3-stateful.

Create a StatefulSet named data-server with 3 replicas in the ckad-q3-stateful namespace using the image mongo:4.0.

Configure the StatefulSet to use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) template to provision volumes.

Each volume should be named mongo-data.

Request 500Mi of storage.

Use the access mode ReadWriteOnce.

Mount the volume inside the container at the path /data/db.

Verification: Check the status of the StatefulSet, and then list the PVCs to ensure they have been dynamically provisioned for each replica (e.g., mongo-data-data-server-0, etc.).
