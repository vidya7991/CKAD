2. ConfigMaps and Environment Variables (12 Minutes)
A web application needs configuration data passed via environment variables.

Ensure you are working in the default namespace.

Create a ConfigMap named app-settings with the following key/value pairs:

UI_COLOR: blue

API_URL: http://api.backend.svc.cluster.local

Create a Deployment named web-app-deploy with 3 replicas using the image nginx.

Configure the Deployment's Pods to expose the data from the app-settings ConfigMap as environment variables inside the containers, using the original ConfigMap keys as the variable names.

Verification: Confirm that a Pod created by the Deployment has the UI_COLOR environment variable set to blue.
