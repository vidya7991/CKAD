4. Troubleshooting and Rollback (12 Minutes)
A Deployment update has failed and needs to be reverted.

Context: A Deployment named frontend in the default namespace is currently running and stable with the image nginx:latest.

Scenario: An attempt was made to update the Deployment with a non-existent image (nginx:non-existent-tag).

Simulate this by running: kubectl set image deployment/frontend nginx=nginx:non-existent-tag --record

Troubleshoot: Identify the problem causing the rollout to fail or get stuck. Check the Deployment status, ReplicaSet events, and Pod logs/events.

Action: Perform a rollback to the previous, successful version of the Deployment.

Verification: Verify that the Deployment's Pods are running the correct nginx:latest image again.
