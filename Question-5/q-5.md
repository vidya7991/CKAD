5. Persistent Volume Claim (12 Minutes)
A database application needs persistent storage.

Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) named db-data-pvc with:

Access Mode: ReadWriteOnce

Storage Request: 1Gi

Storage Class: (Assume a default storage class is available, or omit if none is specified by the problem).

Create a Pod named db-pod using the image mongo:4.0.

Mount the db-data-pvc volume to the container at the path /data/db.

Verification: Check the status of the PVC and the Pod to ensure the volume is successfully bound and mounted.
