1. Pod and Multi-Container (12 Minutes)
A new application requires two containers running in a single Pod.

Create a Namespace named ckad-q1.

Create a Pod named multi-log-pod in the ckad-q1 namespace.

The Pod should have two containers:

Container A: Name: logger-a, Image: busybox, Command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Log A: $(date)' >> /var/log/app.log; sleep 5; done"].

Container B: Name: logger-b, Image: busybox, Command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Log B: $(date)' >> /var/log/app.log; sleep 5; done"].

Both containers must share a single volume named log-volume mounted at /var/log within each container.

Troubleshoot: After creation, ensure the Pod is running and has both containers logging to the same file. Use kubectl logs and kubectl exec to verify the combined output.
