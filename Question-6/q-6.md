6. Networking Policy Enforcement (12 Minutes)
You need to enforce strict network security for a database application.

Create a Namespace named ckad-set2-q1.

In this namespace, create a Deployment named db-deploy with 2 replicas using the image busybox and the label app: database.

Create a Deployment named frontend-deploy with 1 replica using the image busybox and the label app: frontend.

Create a NetworkPolicy named db-access-policy that only allows incoming traffic to Pods with the label app: database from Pods that have the label app: frontend within the same namespace.

Verification: Attempt to kubectl exec into a frontend-deploy Pod and use wget (or similar networking tool if available in the busybox image) to try to connect to a db-deploy Pod's IP address (You will need to determine the Pod IP first). Then, attempt the same connection from a non-labeled Pod and verify the connection is blocked.
