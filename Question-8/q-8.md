1. The Stateful Data API (StatefulSet & Multi-Container)
You need a stateful application that hosts the data and an auxiliary sidecar to monitor its health.

Create a StatefulSet named data-api with 2 replicas in the data-processor-ns namespace.

Use the image nginx:latest for the main container, listening on port 8080.

Implement a multi-container architecture by adding a sidecar container named health-monitor using the image busybox. This container should continuously log a health check status (e.g., ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Data API is healthy' >> /dev/termination-log; sleep 10; done"]).

The ConfigMap key LOG_LEVEL must be exposed as an environment variable named API_LOG_LEVEL in the main container.
