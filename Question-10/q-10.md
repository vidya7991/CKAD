3. The Scheduled Backup Task (CronJob & Pod Template)
You need a scheduled job to run data backups.

Create a CronJob named daily-backup in the data-processor-ns namespace that runs every day at 23:00 (0 23 * * *).

The job's Pod template must use the image busybox and execute the command ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Starting backup using $DB_USER...'; sleep 5;"].

The job's Pod must mount the db-credentials Secret as a volume at /etc/secrets/db/ and use the mounted file to set the environment variable DB_USER (Hint: Use envFrom or valueFrom).
